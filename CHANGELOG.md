# Changelog

All notable changes to the Layers MediaWiki Extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.4-REL1_43] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **FR-10 Live Preview: Duplicate layer rendering after save** — After saving layers in the editor, both old and new layer sets would render simultaneously on the article page until refresh. Fixed by properly removing the canvas element from the DOM in `LayersViewer.destroy()`.
- **FR-10 Live Preview: Base image not visible after save** — After saving layers, the base image would become invisible while layers rendered correctly. Fixed by:
  - Storing and restoring original image visibility/opacity styles in `LayersViewer`
  - Clearing the FreshnessChecker sessionStorage cache on save to ensure fresh API data is fetched
  - Re-applying background settings after image load completes
  - Adding fail-safe to show image when no layer data is present
- **FR-10 Live Preview: Stale layer data after save** — The sessionStorage cache in FreshnessChecker could return stale revision info, causing reinitializeViewer to be skipped. Fixed by clearing the cache in `APIManager.handleSaveSuccess()`.
- **Cache invalidation timing** — Changed server-side cache invalidation from deferred to synchronous execution in `ApiLayersSave.php` to prevent race conditions where users navigate before cache purge completes.

---

## [1.4.3] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Draggable Callout Tail** — Callout tail can now be positioned by dragging the tip directly on the canvas
  - Tail tip position stored in local coordinates for proper rotation support
  - Tail can attach to any edge (top, bottom, left, right) or corner arc
  - Purple handle appears when callout is selected for easy tail repositioning
  - Throttled rendering for smooth drag performance
- **Tail Styles** — Three tail style options for callouts: triangle (default), curved, and line
  - Triangle: Classic speech bubble pointer
  - Curved: Smooth quadratic Bézier curves for organic look
  - Line: Simple single-line pointer
  - Styles work correctly on both straight edges and rounded corners

### Fixed
- **B Key Shortcut Mapping** — The `B` key now correctly selects the Callout tool (was incorrectly mapped to Blur tool)
- **Console.error Security Issue** — Replaced `console.error` with `mw.log.error` in CalloutRenderer.js error handling to follow MediaWiki security best practices (prevents potential information disclosure in production)
- **Corner Arc Tail Rendering** — Tail now renders correctly when positioned on rounded corners
  - Proper angle normalization ensures symmetric behavior at all four corners
  - Arc splitting algorithm correctly handles all tail positions along corner radii
  - No more visual artifacts (gaps, double tails, or misaligned segments)
- **Tail Style on Corners** — Line and curved tail styles now render correctly when tail is on a corner arc (previously defaulted to triangle)

---

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Vector 2022 Dark Mode Compatibility** — Editor now fully supports Vector 2022 skin's night mode (GitHub issue)
  - Added comprehensive dark mode styles for the entire editor UI (toolbar, layer panel, properties panel, dialogs, canvas area)
  - Follows MediaWiki's recommended approach using both class-based selectors (`html.skin-theme-clientpref-night`) and media queries (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` with `html.skin-theme-clientpref-os`)
  - Uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming across all editor components
  - Updated `editor-fixed.css` with ~550 lines of dark mode CSS
  - Updated `presets.css` to use proper Vector 2022 night mode selectors
  - Updated `modal.css` and `LayersLightbox.css` for dark mode support
  - Dark theme uses professional dark colors: `#1a1a1a` (primary bg), `#27292d` (secondary), `#3a3d43` (tertiary), `#eaecf0` (text)
- **Text with apostrophes showing HTML entities after save** — Text containing apostrophes (e.g., "I'M HERE") would display as `I&apos;M HERE` after saving and reopening the editor. The issue was that `TextSanitizer.php` was calling `htmlspecialchars()` before storing text in the JSON database. HTML encoding should only happen at render time, not storage time. Fixed by removing the `htmlspecialchars()` call from `sanitizeText()`.
- **Wrong layer set displayed after editing via `layerslink=editor`** — When opening the editor via a `layerslink=editor` link for a specific layer set (e.g., `layers=anatomy`), then switching to edit a different set, saving, and closing, the article page would display the edited set instead of the set specified in the wikitext. Fixed `ApiFallback.js` to extract the `setname` from the `data-layers-intent` attribute and pass it to the API request.

### Added
- **Callout/Speech Bubble Tool** — New annotation layer type for creating chat bubbles and callouts
  - Rounded rectangle container with configurable corner radius
  - Triangular tail/pointer with 8 direction options (top, bottom, left, right, and corners)

  - Supports all standard layer effects: fill, stroke, opacity, shadow, blur fill
  - Keyboard shortcut: `B`
  - 29 new tests in `CalloutRenderer.test.js`
  - New component: `resources/ext.layers.shared/CalloutRenderer.js`

  - `LayersLightbox.css`: Lightbox overlay, close button, loading states, error display
  - `modal.css`: Modal overlay, header, title, close button, iframe border
  - `presets.css`: Preset dropdowns, menu items, swatches, actions, dividers
  - Uses system colors (ButtonText, Highlight, Canvas, etc.) for automatic adaptation to user's color scheme
  - Added WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA) compliance to ACCESSIBILITY.md
- **Color Picker Hex Input** — Keyboard-accessible hex color input alongside the native color picker
  - Users can type hex values directly (e.g., `#FF5500`) without using mouse
  - Auto-adds `#` prefix when typing without it
  - Real-time validation with visual feedback for invalid values
  - Syncs bidirectionally with native color picker for consistent UX
  - Live preview updates as you type valid colors
  - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard focus management
  - 11 new tests for hex input functionality

### Removed
- **Blur Tool** — The standalone blur tool (`B` shortcut) has been removed as redundant
  - Blur fill (`fill: 'blur'`) on any shape provides the same functionality with more flexibility
  - Use any shape (rectangle, circle, ellipse, polygon, star, arrow) with `fill: 'blur'` instead
  - Blur fill supports strokes, rounded corners, shadows, and rotation that the blur tool lacked
  - The `B` keyboard shortcut is now available for future use

### Added
- **Toolbar Dropdown Grouping** — Reorganized the toolbar using dropdown menus for better scalability
  - Text tools grouped: Text, Text Box
  - Shape tools grouped: Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star
  - Line tools grouped: Arrow, Line
  - Most recently used tool in each group is shown as the visible button

  - 35 new tests in `ToolDropdown.test.js`
  - New component: `resources/ext.layers.editor/ui/ToolDropdown.js`

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Real-time property panel updates** — Transform values (x, y, width, height, rotation) now update in the properties panel immediately during drag/resize/rotate operations
  - Fixed event dispatch/listen target mismatch: `editor.container` was undefined (property was `containerElement`)
  - Added `container` getter on LayersEditor that aliases to `containerElement` for backward compatibility
  - Changed `emitTransforming` to dispatch synchronously instead of throttled via requestAnimationFrame
  - Reordered event/render flow in handleDrag to emit BEFORE renderLayers for immediate UI updates
- **Curved arrow control point during drag** — Control point (`controlX`, `controlY`) now moves with the arrow when dragging, maintaining curve shape
- **Arrow head shadow with spread** — Arrow heads now included in shadow spread calculations for curved arrows via `_buildHeadVertices()`
- **Decimal places in property fields** — Properties panel now displays whole numbers instead of excessive decimal precision (e.g., `123` instead of `123.456789`)

---

- **ESLint config** — Added underscore-prefix pattern (`_paramName`) for intentionally unused parameters
- **ESLint-disable comments** — Reduced from 13 to 8 by using underscore convention instead of inline disables

### Fixed
- **Curved arrow scaling bug** — Control point (`controlX`, `controlY`) was not scaled in `LayersViewer.scaleLayerCoordinates()`, causing dramatic distortion when viewing curved arrows on scaled images
- **Curved arrow blur fill** — Blur fill (frosted glass effect) was not working for curved arrows in `ArrowRenderer.drawCurved()` — now properly calls `effectsRenderer.drawBlurFill()`

---

## [1.2.15] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Background layer label showing raw message key** — The background layer item in the layer panel was displaying `⧼layers-background-layer⧽` instead of "Background Image" because the i18n message was not included in the ResourceLoader module's messages array.

### Removed
- **9 deprecated/non-existent MediaWiki hooks removed** — Cleaned up extension.json and hook handlers:
  - 7 non-existent hooks: `FileLink`, `GetLinkParamDefinitions`, `GetLinkParamTypes`, `ParserGetImageLinkParams`, `ParserGetImageLinkOptions`, `MakeImageLink2`, `LinkerMakeImageLink`

  - Expand/collapse toggles now functional — click the triangle to collapse/expand folders
  - Folder visibility toggle cascades to all child layers
  - "Add Folder" button moved to left of title for better layout
  - Reduced header padding for more compact layer panel

### Added
- **Folder Delete Dialog** — When deleting a folder containing layers, users now choose between:
  - "Delete folder only (keep layers)" — Unparents children, making them top-level layers
  - "Delete folder and all layers inside" — Recursively deletes folder and all contents
- **Batch Undo for Folder Operations** — Folder deletes are now single undo steps using HistoryManager batch mode
- **i18n messages** — `layers-delete-folder-title`, `layers-delete-folder-message`, `layers-delete-folder-keep-children`, `layers-delete-folder-delete-all`
- **LayerListRenderer `onToggleGroupExpand` callback** — Enables folder expand/collapse from rendered layer items
- **CSS for `.layers-btn-icon`** — Compact icon-only buttons in layer panel header

### Fixed

  - **GroupManager.js** (~600 lines) — Full grouping API with `createGroup()`, `ungroup()`, `addToGroup()`, `removeFromGroup()`, `toggleExpanded()`, `getGroupChildren()`, `groupSelected()`, `ungroupSelected()`, `renameGroup()`, `deleteGroup()`, `getGroupBounds()`
  - **Keyboard shortcuts** — **Ctrl+G** to group selected layers, **Ctrl+Shift+G** to ungroup
  - **Selection integration** — Selecting a group automatically selects all children; deselecting a group deselects all children
  - **Server-side validation** — 'group' type with `children` (array), `expanded` (boolean), `parentGroup` (string) properties
  - **Layer Panel UI** — Groups display with folder icons, expand/collapse toggles (▼/▶), and child layer indentation (20px per level)
  - Max nesting depth: 3 levels, max children per group: 100

### Added
- **IconFactory.createFolderIcon()** — Golden folder icon for group layers (expanded/collapsed states)
- **IconFactory.createExpandIcon()** — Triangle toggle icon for expand/collapse
- **LayerItemFactory group support** — Groups render with folder icon, expand toggle, and CSS classes
- **SelectionManager group support** — `_getGroupBounds()`, `isChildOfSelectedGroup()`, `_getGroupDescendantIds()` helpers

---

## [1.2.12] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **Context-Aware Toolbar behavior refined** — Toolbar style controls (stroke, fill, presets) are now **hidden** when an existing layer is selected, since the Properties panel in the Layer Manager provides all the same controls. This eliminates redundancy and focuses users on the appropriate UI. Style controls only appear when a drawing tool is active for creating new layers.

### Documentation
- **Enhanced Architecture diagrams** — Added three new Mermaid diagrams to ARCHITECTURE.md:
  - **Rendering Pipeline** — Shows how render triggers flow through RenderCoordinator to LayerRenderer dispatch
  - **Layer State Machine** — Documents states (Idle, Selected, Drawing, Editing, etc.) and transitions
  - **Data Flow Overview** — Shows client-server data flow between StateManager, APIManager, and PHP endpoints

### Testing
- **7,382 tests passing** (+5 new tests)
- Added 6 new tests for `hideAll()` and `updateForSelectedTypes()` in TextEffectsControls
- Updated context-aware toolbar tests to reflect new behavior (hide on layer selection)

---

## [1.2.11] - 2025-12-29

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed blend modes not rendering on article pages** — Layer blend modes (exclusion, multiply, screen, etc.) were not being applied when viewing images on article pages. The viewer used a transparent canvas overlay on top of the DOM image element, but canvas `globalCompositeOperation` only blends with content already on the canvas, not DOM elements. The viewer now detects when any layer uses a non-default blend mode and draws the background image onto the canvas first, enabling proper blend mode rendering.
- **Fixed blend mode property normalization** — The server stores blend mode as `blendMode` but client code was reading `blend`. Added property alias normalization to ensure both property names work correctly in both editor and viewer.
- **Removed redundant 'blur' from blend mode dropdown** — The 'blur' option in the blend mode dropdown was redundant with the blur fill feature (introduced in v1.2.6) and caused confusion. Blur effects should be applied via Fill → blur, not blend mode.

### Technical
- Added `normalizeAliases()` method to `LayerDataNormalizer.js` for consistent blend/blendMode handling
- Updated `LayersViewer.js` with `drawBackgroundOnCanvas()` method for blend mode support
- Updated `fallbackNormalize()` in viewer to include blend mode alias handling
- Added blend alias normalization tests to LayerDataNormalizer.test.js

### Testing
- **7,377 tests passing** (+80 from v1.2.10)
- **131 test suites**
- Added 5 new tests for blend mode alias normalization

---

## [1.2.10] - 2025-12-28

### Features
- **Context-Aware Toolbar** — Toolbar now shows only relevant controls based on the active tool or selected layers. When using the pointer tool with nothing selected, only tool buttons are visible. Drawing tools reveal stroke/fill controls, text tools show font controls, etc. Smooth CSS transitions (0.2s) animate control visibility changes. Configurable via `$wgLayersContextAwareToolbar` (default: true, set to false for classic mode).

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed MediaWiki 1.39-1.43 LTS compatibility** — Fixed TypeError in `onThumbnailBeforeProduceHTML` hook where `$linkAttribs` parameter could be `false` (boolean) instead of an array when images have no link. The hook now accepts both types for backward compatibility with LTS versions.

### Configuration
- Added `$wgLayersContextAwareToolbar` — Enable/disable context-aware toolbar (default: true)

### Testing
- **7,297 tests passing** (+20 new tests)
- Added 20 new tests for context-aware toolbar functionality covering `updateContextVisibility`, `setContextAwareEnabled`, `isContextAwareEnabled`, `updateContextForSelectedLayers`, and `showAllControls`

---

## [1.2.9] - 2025-12-28

### Features
- **Auto-create layer set on editor link** — When a user clicks a `layerslink=editor` link to a non-existent layer set (e.g., `[[File:Example.jpg|layers=anatomy|layerslink=editor]]`), the set is automatically created if the user has `createlayers` permission. Shows a notification informing the user the set was created. This enables pre-planned article templates with layer set placeholders.

### Testing
- **7,277 tests passing** (+7 from previous)
- **130 test suites**
- **94.45% statement coverage**, 82.88% branch coverage, 91.98% function coverage, 94.73% line coverage
- **PropertiesForm.js: Improved coverage (68% → 72% function coverage)** — 25 new tests for ColorPickerDialog integration, validation edge cases, blur fill panel refresh, opacity change handling
- **ImageLoader.js: First dedicated test file** — 47 tests organized for background image loading, URL building, same-origin detection, SVG placeholders, abort/destroy cleanup
- **LayerItemFactory.js: First dedicated test file** — 51 tests for layer item DOM creation, updates, icon delegation, keyboard navigation, ARIA accessibility
- **LayersEditor.js: Auto-create tests** — 6 new tests for showAutoCreateNotification, autoCreateLayerSet, and finalizeInitialState

### Documentation

- **FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md**: Added section 8 for auto-create layer set feature
- **New feature request**: Auto-create layer set on editor link ([FEATURE_REQUEST_AUTO_CREATE_LAYER_SET.md](docs/FEATURE_REQUEST_AUTO_CREATE_LAYER_SET.md))
- **README.md**: Added coverage (94%), test count (7,277), and license badges
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated god class table with accurate line counts, fixed broken documentation links
- **SECURITY.md**: Enhanced with proper vulnerability reporting section and improved formatting

---

## [1.2.8] - 2025-12-27

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed rectangle blur fill appearing transparent** — Rectangles with blur fill were appearing completely transparent because rotation transformation modified x/y coordinates to local space before passing to EffectsRenderer.drawBlurFill. Now stores world coordinates (worldX, worldY) BEFORE rotation and passes those to drawBlurFill for correct canvas capture bounds.
- **Fixed arrow rendering with blur blend mode** — Arrows with blur blend mode (set via Blend Mode dropdown) no longer display rectangular bounding boxes in the editor. The issue was that the blur blend mode path used rectangular clip regions instead of the arrow's actual shape. Arrows and lines now render normally and ArrowRenderer handles blur fill correctly via EffectsRenderer.
- **Fixed arrow fill property** — Arrows were being created without a `fill` property, causing ArrowRenderer to only stroke (not fill) the polygon outline. Added explicit `fill: style.color` to ShapeFactory.createArrow() and BuiltInPresets arrow definitions.

### Technical
- Updated ShapeRenderer.drawRectangle() to store world coordinates before rotation transformation
- Updated CanvasRenderer.js to skip arrows/lines from blur blend mode rendering path
- Updated LayerRenderer.js (shared) with same fix for consistency
- Added fill and arrowSize properties to arrow presets in BuiltInPresets.js
- **Replaced console.log with mw.log** — Toolbar.js and LayersEditorModal.js now use MediaWiki's logging system instead of console methods for consistency and proper production logging

### Security
- **Fixed npm security vulnerabilities** — Updated `glob` 10.4.5 → 10.5.0 (high: command injection via CLI) and `js-yaml` 3.14.1 → 3.14.2 (moderate: prototype pollution)

### Testing
- **7,247 tests passing** (+371 since start of v1.2.8 development)

## [1.2.7] - 2025-12-26

### New Feature - Blur Fill for Arrows

Extended the blur fill feature (introduced in v1.2.6) to support **arrow shapes**. Arrows can now use the "frosted glass" blur effect just like rectangles, circles, and other shapes.

**How to Use:**
1. Select an arrow layer
2. In the Properties panel, check **Blur Fill**
3. Adjust **Blur Radius** (default: 12px, range: 1-64px)

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed "Invalid blend mode" validation error blocking save** — Layer sets containing arrows with blur fill could not be saved due to `blur` being incorrectly rejected as an invalid blend mode. Updated both client-side (`LayersValidator.js`) and server-side (`ServerSideLayerValidator.php`) validators to:
  - Include all Canvas 2D `globalCompositeOperation` values (`source-over`, `multiply`, etc.)
  - Add special case handling for `blur` as a fill type indicator (not a blend mode)

### UI Improvements
- **Compact layer panel** — Layer manager redesigned with a more compact look inspired by Figma and Photoshop:
  - Layer item height reduced from 36px to 28px
  - Control buttons reduced from 28px to 22px
  - Padding and gaps reduced throughout
  - Properties panel given flex priority (more space for properties, less for layer list)
  - Default view shows ~6 layers before scrolling

### Testing
- **6,756 tests passing** (+38 from v1.2.6)
- Added blur fill tests for ArrowRenderer
- Added blur fill tests for TextBoxRenderer
- All linting passes (ESLint, Stylelint, PHP CodeSniffer)

---

## [1.2.6] - 2025-12-25

### New Feature - Blur Fill for Shapes

Added **blur fill mode** for all filled shapes — a "frosted glass" effect that blurs the content beneath the shape instead of using a solid color fill.

**Supported Shapes:**
- Rectangle
- Circle / Ellipse
- Polygon / Star
- Text Box

**How to Use:**
1. Select a shape layer
2. In the Properties panel, set **Fill** to `blur`
3. Optionally adjust **Blur Radius** (default: 12px, range: 1-64px)
4. Adjust **Fill Opacity** to control the effect intensity

**Technical Details:**
- Works with rotation — blur correctly follows rotated shapes
- Works in both editor and article view
- Captures all content beneath (background image + other layers)
- Falls back to gray placeholder if no background available

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed blur fill with rotated shapes** — Blur now correctly captures and clips content for shapes with any rotation angle. Previously, rotated shapes would show distorted or misaligned blur content.

### Testing
- **6,718 tests passing** (+72 from v1.2.5)
- Added comprehensive blur fill tests for TextBoxRenderer
- All linting passes (ESLint, Stylelint, PHP CodeSniffer)

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-12-24

### Improved Editor Navigation

**Breaking Change (UX Improvement):** When using `layerslink=editor` from an article page, closing the editor now returns you to the article page instead of the File: page. This is the expected behavior - the editor should return you to where you came from.

### New Features - Advanced Editor Link Modes

Added new `layerslink` values for additional control:

#### `layerslink=editor-newtab`
Opens the editor in a new browser tab, preserving the original page:
```wikitext
[[File:Diagram.png|layers=anatomy|layerslink=editor-newtab]]
```

#### `layerslink=editor-modal`
Opens the editor in an iframe overlay without any page navigation — perfect for Page Forms:
```wikitext
[[File:Diagram.png|layers=anatomy|layerslink=editor-modal]]
```

**Modal Mode Features:**
- No page navigation (form data is preserved)
- Escape key closes the modal
- Full ARIA accessibility support
- JavaScript events for integration: `layers-modal-closed`, `layers-saved`

### Technical
- **New module**: `ext.layers.modal` — Modal overlay component with postMessage communication
- **New files**:
  - `resources/ext.layers.modal/LayersEditorModal.js` — Modal class with iframe management
  - `resources/ext.layers.modal/modal.css` — Modal overlay styles
- **Modified files**:
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/LayersParamExtractor.php` — Added `isEditorNewtab()`, `isEditorReturn()`, `isEditorModal()` methods
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/ThumbnailProcessor.php` — ALL editor links now include `returnto` parameter
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/ImageLinkProcessor.php` — ALL editor links now include `returnto` parameter
  - `src/Hooks/WikitextHooks.php` — Accept new layerslink values in validation
  - `src/Action/EditLayersAction.php` — Added `returnto` URL validation, `isModalMode` flag, new JS config vars
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/LayersEditor.js` — Modified `navigateBackToFileWithName()` for modal/return modes
  - `i18n/en.json`, `i18n/qqq.json` — Added 5 new message keys
  - `extension.json` — Added `ext.layers.modal` ResourceModule
  - `jest.config.js` — Added `ext.layers.modal` to coverage tracking
  - `docs/WIKITEXT_USAGE.md` — Documented new layerslink modes

### Testing
- **6,646 tests passing** (+23 from v1.2.4)
- Added comprehensive Jest tests for `LayersEditorModal`
- All linting passes (ESLint, Stylelint, PHP CodeSniffer)

---

## [1.2.4] - 2025-12-23

### Code Quality - Major Testing & Documentation Update

This release focuses on improving test coverage for critical components and ensuring documentation accuracy.

#### Native Dialog Accessibility ✅
- **PresetDropdown.js** — Replaced `prompt()` and `confirm()` calls with async DialogManager dialogs
- **RevisionManager.js** — Replaced `confirm()` call with async DialogManager dialog
- Both now have proper fallbacks using `eslint-disable-next-line no-alert` comments

#### Test Coverage Improvements
- **DialogManager.js** — Coverage increased from 53% to **96.14%** statement coverage (+35 tests)
- **PropertiesForm.js** — Function coverage increased from 41% to **68.22%** (+39 tests)
- **Total test count** — 6,549 → **6,623** (+74 tests)

#### Memory Leak Prevention
- **CanvasManager.js** — Added `fallbackTimeoutId` tracking for setTimeout cleanup
- **LayersLightbox.js** — Added `closeTimeoutId` tracking for setTimeout cleanup

#### Documentation Accuracy
- **codebase_review.md** — Updated with accurate current metrics (was outdated)
- **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** — Rewrote to reflect all P0 issues now resolved
- Changed overall rating from 7.5/10 to **8.5/10** based on verified improvements

### Technical Details
- **Modified files**:
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/presets/PresetDropdown.js` — Async DialogManager integration
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/ui/PresetStyleManager.js` — Pass dialogManager to PresetDropdown
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/editor/RevisionManager.js` — Async confirm dialog
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/CanvasManager.js` — Timer ID tracking
  - `resources/ext.layers/viewer/LayersLightbox.js` — Timer ID tracking
  - `tests/jest/DialogManager.test.js` — 35 new tests for Promise-based APIs
  - `tests/jest/PropertiesForm.test.js` — 39 new tests for layer forms
  - `codebase_review.md` — Accurate metrics
  - `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — All P0 issues marked resolved

---

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-23

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed text box rendering when image is scaled down** — Text boxes with vertical centering (middle alignment) now display correctly when images are resized in article view. Previously, the top line of text would be cut off because the `padding` property was not being scaled along with other dimensions.

### Technical
- **Modified files**:
  - `resources/ext.layers/LayersViewer.js` — Added `padding` to `scaleLayerCoordinates()` to scale with the image
  - `tests/jest/LayersViewer.test.js` — Added regression test for padding scaling

### Code Quality
- **UIManager refactored** — Extracted `SetSelectorController.js` (~567 lines) from `UIManager.js`, reducing it from 1,029 to 681 lines. This improves separation of concerns for named layer set management.

### Testing
- **6,549 tests passing** (+70 from v1.2.2)
- **All linting passes** (ESLint, Stylelint, PHP CodeSniffer)

---

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-23

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed `layerslink=editor` and `layerslink=viewer` not working** — Deep linking parameters now correctly modify the image link destination. Previously, clicking layered images with these parameters would still navigate to the File: page instead of opening the editor or lightbox viewer. The fix ensures the `ThumbnailBeforeProduceHTML` hook properly modifies the anchor `href` attribute.
- **Fixed editor dropdown showing 'default' on deep link** — When using `layerslink=editor` with a specific layer set (e.g., `layers=anatomy`), the set selector dropdown in the editor now correctly shows the loaded set name instead of always showing 'default'.

### Technical
- **Hook flow discovery**: MediaWiki 1.44 uses `ThumbnailBeforeProduceHTML` for thumbnail rendering instead of `MakeImageLink2`. The `$linkAttribs` parameter must be modified to change anchor destinations.
- **Queue synchronization**: Added `$fileLinkTypes` queue in `WikitextHooks.php` to track `layerslink` values per file occurrence, synchronized with the existing `$fileSetNames` queue.
- **Modified files**:
  - `src/Hooks/WikitextHooks.php` — Added `$fileLinkTypes` queue and `getFileParamsForRender()` method for synchronized parameter retrieval
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/ThumbnailProcessor.php` — Added `applyLayersLink()` method that modifies `$linkAttribs['href']` for deep linking
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/ImageLinkProcessor.php` — Added `$linkTypeFromQueue` parameter support
  - `src/Hooks/Processors/LayersParamExtractor.php` — Enhanced `extractLayersLink()` to check nested parameter locations
  - `resources/ext.layers.editor/APIManager.js` — Fixed ordering: `currentSetName` is now set before `buildSetSelector()` is called
  - `wiki/Wikitext-Syntax.md` — Clarified that `layerslink` must be used with `layers`

### Testing
- **6,479 tests passing** (Jest)
- **All PHP linting and style checks pass**

---

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-23

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed corner radius scaling on article pages** — Shape corner radii (`cornerRadius`, `pointRadius`, `valleyRadius`) now scale correctly when images are resized in article view. Previously, stars, polygons, textboxes, and rounded rectangles would display with full-size radii even when the image was scaled smaller, causing visual artifacts.

### Developer Experience
- **Added Docker-based PHP test scripts** — New npm scripts `test:php:docker` and `fix:php:docker` for Windows developers who may have composer conflicts (Python's `composer` package can shadow PHP's Composer). These scripts run PHP linting tools inside the MediaWiki Docker container.

### Testing
- **E2E test improvements** — Fixed race conditions in editor E2E tests, improved login handling, corrected save response detection for MediaWiki API POST requests, and fixed path/pen tool test expectations.

### Technical
- **Modified files**:
  - `resources/ext.layers/LayersViewer.js` — Added scaling for `cornerRadius`, `pointRadius`, `valleyRadius` in `scaleLayerCoordinates()`
  - `resources/ext.layers.shared/PolygonStarRenderer.js` — Added scaling in `drawPolygon()` and `drawStar()` when `scaled: false`
  - `package.json` — Added `test:php:docker` and `fix:php:docker` scripts
  - `tests/e2e/editor.spec.js` — Fixed test stability issues
  - `tests/e2e/fixtures.js` — Fixed save() response detection

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### New Features
- **Deep Linking to Editor** — URL parameters now allow opening the editor with a specific layer set pre-loaded:
  - `?action=editlayers&setname=anatomy` — Opens editor with "anatomy" layer set
  - Also supports `layerset` and `layers` parameter aliases
  - Set name validation: alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only (max 50 chars)

- **Wikitext Link Options** — New `layerslink` parameter for controlling click behavior on images with layers:
  - `[[File:Example.jpg|layers=setname|layerslink=editor]]` — Opens layer editor for this image
  - `[[File:Example.jpg|layers=setname|layerslink=viewer]]` — Opens fullscreen lightbox viewer
  - `[[File:Example.jpg|layers=setname|layerslink=lightbox]]` — Alias for viewer mode
  - Default behavior (no layerslink): Standard MediaWiki link to File page

- **Fullscreen Lightbox Viewer** — New modal viewer for viewing layered images in full size:
  - Keyboard accessible: Escape key closes the lightbox
  - Click outside image to close
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Proper accessibility attributes (ARIA)

### Technical
- **New files added**:
  - `resources/ext.layers/viewer/LayersLightbox.js` — Lightbox component (~450 lines)
  - `resources/ext.layers/viewer/LayersLightbox.css` — Lightbox styling (~140 lines)
- **Modified files**:
  - `EditLayersAction.php` — URL parameter parsing for setname
  - `WikitextHooks.php` — layerslink parameter registration
  - `LayersParamExtractor.php` — layerslink extraction methods
  - `ImageLinkProcessor.php` — Link modification for deep linking
  - `EditorBootstrap.js` — Pass initialSetName to editor
  - `LayersEditor.js` — Load initial set by name on startup

### Documentation
- Added i18n messages for link titles and lightbox UI

---

## [1.1.12] - 2025-12-22

### Code Quality
- **Memory leak prevention (P2.4)** — Added timeout tracking to `APIManager.js` and `ImageLoader.js` with proper cleanup in `destroy()` methods. Added `_scheduleTimeout()`, `_clearAllTimeouts()`, and `activeTimeouts` tracking.
- **Reduced god classes (P2.2)** — Removed 189 lines of dead `_validateNumericPropertiesFallback` code from `LayersValidator.js`, reducing it from 1,036 to 843 lines (now under 1,000 threshold).
- **Magic numbers extracted (P2.5)** — Added `TIMING` section to `LayersConstants.js` with 9 named delay constants: `IMAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT`, `BOOTSTRAP_RETRY_DELAY`, `HOOK_LISTENER_DELAY`, `DEPENDENCY_WAIT_DELAY`, `API_RETRY_DELAY`, `DEBOUNCE_DEFAULT`, `NOTIFICATION_DURATION`, `ANIMATION_DURATION`, `SAVE_BUTTON_DISABLE_DELAY`.
- **Updated files to use timing constants** — `ImageLoader.js` and `EditorBootstrap.js` now use `LayersConstants.TIMING` instead of magic numbers.

### Testing
- **6,479 tests passing** (+2 from v1.1.11)
- **92% statement coverage, 80% branch coverage**
- Added 2 new tests for TIMING constants validation

### Documentation
- Updated `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` with 2 new feature requests:
  - **Deep Linking to Editor** — URL parameters to open editor with specific file/layer set/layer
  - **Lightbox Viewer** — `link=layers` option for inline viewing without navigation
- Added 8 world-class feature ideas: collaborative editing, layer templates, AI-assisted annotations, animation mode, measurement tools, layer linking/hotspots, version comparison, mobile touch support
- Updated all documentation with current metrics (96 JS files, 87 ES6 classes, 6,479 tests)

---

## [1.1.11] - 2025-12-22

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed ToolStyles.js constructor initialization order** — Fixed bug where `this.update()` was called before `this.listeners = []` was initialized, causing a crash when `initialStyle` was provided to the constructor.
- **Added opacity extraction to ToolStyles** — `extractFromLayer()` now properly extracts the `opacity` property from layers.

### Testing
- **Test coverage improved to 92.19%** — Up from 90.09% statements
- **Branch coverage now exceeds 80%** — 80.19% (up from 77.53%)
- **6,337 tests passing** — Added 238 new tests
- Added comprehensive `APIErrorHandler.test.js` — 56 new tests (0% → 98.03%)
- Added comprehensive `NamespaceHelper.test.js` — 19 new tests (73.91% → 95.65%)
- Extended `ToolStyles.test.js` — +33 tests (78.67% → 100%)
- Extended `LayersViewer.test.js` — +13 tests (80.15% → 91.26%)

### Code Quality
- Updated `codebase_review.md` with current metrics
- Updated `improvement_plan.md` — P2.1 (Add Tests) now marked complete

---

## [1.1.10] - 2025-12-21

### Security
- **Removed SVG from allowed image imports** — SVG files can contain embedded JavaScript, creating XSS vulnerabilities. Removed `image/svg+xml` from allowed MIME types in `ServerSideLayerValidator.php`. Users requiring SVG support should implement proper sanitization.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed foreign repository file lookup** — `ApiLayersDelete` and `ApiLayersRename` now use `getRepoGroup()->findFile()` instead of `getLocalRepo()->findFile()`, enabling proper support for files from foreign repositories like Wikimedia Commons.

### Code Quality
- **Improved Jest coverage configuration** — Updated `collectCoverageFrom` in `jest.config.js` to track all source directories using comprehensive glob patterns, providing more accurate coverage reporting.

### Documentation
- Updated `codebase_review.md` with comprehensive technical assessment
- Updated `improvement_plan.md` with P1 items marked complete
- Updated `README.md` with accurate metrics and security notes

### Testing
- **5,766 tests passing** (maintained from v1.1.9)

---

## [1.1.9] - 2025-12-21

### Bug Fixes
- **Background visibility resetting to visible when re-opening editor** — Fixed bug where background saved as hidden would show as visible when returning to the editor.
  - **Root cause:** JavaScript used `visible !== false` which returns `true` for integer `0` because strict equality doesn't convert types.
  - **Solution:** Fixed three locations to check `visible !== false && visible !== 0` and normalize integers to booleans at API boundary in `APIManager.extractLayerSetData()`.
  - **Files fixed:** `APIManager.js`, `BackgroundLayerController.js`, `LayerPanel.js`
  - **See:** `docs/POSTMORTEM_BACKGROUND_VISIBILITY_BUG.md` for full analysis

### Security
- **Added setname sanitization** — `ApiLayersDelete.php` and `ApiLayersRename.php` now sanitize user-supplied set names

### Code Quality
- **Extracted MathUtils.js** — Created shared utility module for `clampOpacity()` and other math functions (DRY improvement)
- **Fixed memory leak** — Added `cancelAnimationFrame()` to `CanvasManager.destroy()`
- **Fixed console.error** — Replaced with `mw.log.error()` in `ViewerManager.js`
- **Added BackgroundLayerController** — Added missing file to ResourceLoader modules

### Testing
- Added 4 new tests in `APIManager.test.js` for integer 0/1 normalization
- Added 2 new tests in `BackgroundLayerController.test.js` for integer 0/1 handling
- Fixed failing test in `LayersViewer.test.js` (opacity assertion)
- **5,766 tests passing**

### Documentation
- Added `docs/POSTMORTEM_BACKGROUND_VISIBILITY_BUG.md` — Comprehensive post-mortem preventing recurrence
- Updated `copilot-instructions.md` with critical PHP→JS boolean serialization warning
- Updated `improvement_plan.md` — P0 items now marked complete

---

## [1.1.8] - 2025-12-21

### Bug Fixes
- **Background visibility not applied on article pages** — Fixed critical bug where `backgroundVisible: false` was not being honored on article pages when using the API fallback path (for large layer sets >100KB).
  - **Root cause:** MediaWiki's API result system drops boolean `false` values during JSON serialization. The `preserveLayerBooleans()` method in `ApiLayersInfo.php` was only converting layer-level booleans to integers, but missed `backgroundVisible` at the data level.
  - **Solution:** Extended `preserveLayerBooleans()` to also convert `backgroundVisible` to 0/1 integer, ensuring it serializes correctly through the API.
  - **Affected:** Layer sets larger than 100KB that use the API fallback path for data fetching.

### Testing
- Added `ApiLayersInfoBooleanPreservationTest.php` with 8 tests to prevent regression of boolean serialization issues

---

## [1.1.7] - 2025-12-20

### New Features
- **Smart Guides** — Intelligent snapping to other objects
  - Snap to object edges (left, right, top, bottom)
  - Snap to object centers (horizontal, vertical)
  - Visual guide lines: magenta for edges, cyan for centers
  - 8px snap threshold, **off by default** — toggle with `;` key
- **Arrange Dropdown Menu** — Consolidated toolbar UI
  - New "Arrange & Snap" dropdown replaces 8 individual alignment buttons
  - Contains: Smart Guides toggle, Align options, Distribute options
  - Saves toolbar space for future features
  - Shows disabled state when insufficient layers selected

### Changes
- Removed standalone eyedropper button from toolbar (use the eyedropper within the browser's color picker instead)
- Removed **I**/**Shift+I** keyboard shortcuts (eyedropper available via native color picker)
- Smart guides now **off by default** — press `;` to toggle or use Arrange menu
- Updated blur tool documentation — now described as visual effect only, removed "redaction" and "privacy" terminology

### Cleanup
- Removed unused `EyedropperController` module (~480 lines, 66 tests) — redundant with browser's native color picker
- Removed eyedropper CSS styles and ToolRegistry entry

### Refactoring
- Extracted `SmartGuidesController` (~500 lines)
- Consolidated alignment buttons into dropdown menu

### Testing
- Added 43 new tests for Smart Guides
- Total tests: 5,609 passing

---

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-20

### New Features
- **Key Object Alignment**: Industry-standard alignment behavior (Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop pattern)
  - When multiple layers are selected, the last selected layer becomes the "key object"
  - Other layers align TO the key object, which stays fixed
  - Key object is visually distinguished with an orange border instead of blue
  - Works for all alignment operations: left, center, right, top, middle, bottom
  - Fallback to combined bounds when no key object is available
- **Text Layer Alignment**: Text layers now properly participate in alignment operations
  - Text dimensions are measured using canvas context for accurate bounds
  - Fallback estimation for environments without canvas context

### Bug Fixes
- **Alignment buttons working**: Fixed AlignmentController constructor to accept both CanvasManager directly and config object
- **Selection tracking**: Fixed `lastSelectedId` not being updated in multiple code paths:
  - LayerPanel.selectLayer now updates lastSelectedId
  - MarqueeSelection callback updates lastSelectedId
  - handleLayerSelection updates lastSelectedId for canvas clicks
  - selectAll/deselectAll maintain lastSelectedId correctly
  - ClipboardController.paste sets lastSelectedId for pasted layers

### Code Quality
- **ColorControlFactory.js extracted** (~244 lines): New UI module for color picker control creation
  - Reduces ToolbarStyleControls.js complexity
  - Reusable color button creation with proper ARIA support
- **AlignmentController.test.js added** (~395 lines): Comprehensive test suite
  - Tests for key object alignment pattern
  - Tests for all alignment and distribution operations
  - Tests for bounds calculation for different layer types
- **Debug logging cleanup**: Removed all console.log statements from AlignmentController.js

---

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-18

### Bug Fixes
- **Text shadow rendering fix**: Text shadows on text box layers now render correctly in article view. Previously, text shadows would display in the editor but not when viewing the annotated image on article pages.
  - Root cause: Boolean properties like `textShadow` were stored as strings ("true"/"1") but rendering code used strict equality (`=== true`)
  - Solution: Created shared `LayerDataNormalizer.js` utility used by both editor and viewer
- **Image layer shadows**: Shadows on image layers now render correctly in article view

### Code Quality
- **LayerDataNormalizer.js extracted** (~228 lines): New shared utility in `ext.layers.shared/` for consistent data type normalization
  - Normalizes boolean properties: `shadow`, `textShadow`, `glow`, `visible`, `locked`, `preserveAspectRatio`
  - Normalizes numeric properties: 20+ properties including coordinates, dimensions, opacity, shadow values
  - Single source of truth - both editor and viewer use this
- **SelectionRenderer.js extracted** (~349 lines): Selection UI rendering extracted from CanvasRenderer
  - CanvasRenderer reduced from 1,132 to **834 lines** (no longer a god class!)
- **APIErrorHandler.js extracted** (~347 lines): Error handling extracted from APIManager
  - APIManager reduced from 1,385 to **1,168 lines**
- **God classes reduced from 9 to 7**: CanvasRenderer and TextBoxRenderer both now under 1,000 lines
- **47 new tests added**: LayerDataNormalizer (46 tests), SelectionRenderer (28 tests), LayersViewer shadow tests
- **Total test count: 5,297 tests passing** (+61 from v1.1.2)

### Technical Notes
- The text shadow bug was a classic type coercion issue - JSON serialization loses type information
- LayerDataNormalizer is loaded first in ext.layers.shared module to ensure availability
- Fallback normalization preserved for testing environments where shared module may not load

## [CRITICAL REVIEW] - 2025-12-18

### Project Health Assessment

**Status:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Accumulating Technical Debt**

A comprehensive critical review revealed that while the extension is **functional and production-ready**, the rate of feature development is outpacing debt reduction efforts. See [`CRITICAL_REVIEW_2025-12-18.md`](CRITICAL_REVIEW_2025-12-18.md) for full analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- \u2705 Core functionality works well, users satisfied
- \u2705 5,236 tests passing, 92% coverage
- \u2705 Professional security practices
- \u26a0\ufe0f **Codebase grew 14% in 30 days** (35.7K → 40.7K LOC)
- \u274c **9 god classes** (~12K LOC) - CI now blocks growth (Dec 18)
- \u274c No E2E tests in CI

**Recommended Actions:**
1. 2705 **P0:** Add CI check preventing god class growth - **DONE**
2. **P0:** Set up E2E tests in CI
3. **P1:** Split APIManager and SelectionManager
4. **Consider:** Feature freeze until debt controlled

See improvement_plan.md for detailed remediation roadmap.

  - `TextToolHandler.js` (~210 lines): Handles inline text input UI for creating text layers
  - `PathToolHandler.js` (~230 lines): Handles freeform path drawing with click-to-add points
  - ToolManager now delegates to handlers when available, with inline fallback for backwards compatibility
- **Test coverage improvements across multiple files**:
  - CanvasRenderer.js: 77.81% → 91.12% (+13.3%)
  - LayersNamespace.js: 78.68% → 81.96% (+3.3%)
  - Toolbar.js: 82.82% → 90% (+7.2%)
  - UIManager.js: 81.34% → 95.44% (+14.1%)
