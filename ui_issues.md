Placeholder tags are rendered in the editor. This is what the user sees:
  ⧼layers-revision-label⧽:
  ⧼layers-revision-latest⧽
  ⧼layers-revision-name-placeholder⧽
  ⧼layers-revision-load⧽
  ⧼layers-import⧽
  ⧼layers-export⧽
Please fix these.

Why are the input boxes so long? Why so many decimal places? position, rotation, width, height, opacity, (basically all of them) should be max 1 decimal (0.1) resolution and the box should reflect that.
Why is the blend dropdown soooo loooong?

The cursor changes as expected when hovering over layer icons, but they are only clickable in a small area in the lower right corner of each. Most of the icon is not clickable (applys to visibilit, lock, and delete icons).
The padlock and delete icons look horrible.
When I select an item on the canvas, it gives a selection box with handles, which tells me that it's selected, but why doesn't it show as selected in the layer manager? I would expect to select it in canvas, it becomes selected in manager and the selected layer's properties should be displayed.
