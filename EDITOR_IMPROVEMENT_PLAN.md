    - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+N)
    - Tool selection automatically creates layers when drawing

#### 10.2 README.md Corrections
**Current Problem**: README claims completion of features that don't exist or are partially implemented.

**Required Corrections**:
- Update status percentages to be realistic (~15% complete for professional editor)
- Remove or qualify claims about "full-featured image editor"
- Add detailed "What Actually Works" vs "What's Planned" sections
- Include honest assessment of production readiness
- Add clear roadmap with realistic timelines

## Implementation Priority Matrix (REVISED)

### Phase 1: Critical Backend Issues (Weeks 1-2) 
**Priority: CRITICAL - Prevents production use**
1. **Fix server-side rendering** - Images with layers don't show in articles (SHOWSTOPPER)
2. **Complete wikitext integration** - Parser hooks need completion 
3. **Performance optimization** - Memory management for large images
4. **Remove remaining debug code** - Clean up any remaining console.log statements
5. **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests and integration tests

### Phase 2: Polish Existing Features (Weeks 3-4)
**Priority: HIGH - Improve user experience**
1. **Advanced text features** - Font family dropdown, text alignment
2. **Enhanced keyboard shortcuts** - More tool shortcuts and modifiers
3. **Polygon editing mode** - Edit points after shape creation
4. **Performance optimizations** - Efficient canvas rendering
5. **Mobile improvements** - Better touch interaction

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Nice to have**
1. **Rich text editing** - Inline text editor with formatting
2. **Advanced shape tools** - Bezier curves, custom shapes
3. **Layer grouping** - Folder organization for layers  
4. **Animation support** - Simple transitions and effects
5. **Import/export enhancements** - SVG import, better file formats

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Weeks 9-12)
**Priority: LOW - Future expansion**
1. **Collaboration tools** - Real-time editing, comments
2. **Template system** - Reusable design templates
3. **Advanced layer effects** - Complex blending and filters
4. **Plugin architecture** - Third-party tool integration
5. **Analytics and usage tracking** - Performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The Layers extension is **significantly more advanced** than its documentation suggests. The frontend is a sophisticated, professional-grade image editor that rivals commercial applications. The main barrier to production deployment is incomplete backend integration, not missing frontend features.

**Revised Assessment**: 
- **Frontend**: 85% complete for professional editing
- **Backend Integration**: 35% complete  
- **Overall Production Readiness**: 60% complete

**Recommendation**: Focus entirely on backend completion rather than frontend features. The editor UI is already excellent.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations
- **Modular Design**: Each tool and feature should be implemented as a separate module
- **Event System**: Implement a comprehensive event system for tool communication
- **State Management**: Centralized state management for undo/redo and layer operations
- **Plugin Architecture**: Allow for future extension development

### Code Quality Requirements
- **TypeScript Migration**: Consider migrating to TypeScript for better maintainability
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- **Documentation**: Inline documentation and usage examples
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and optimization tracking

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Target Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for older browsers where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features

## Conclusion

This improvement plan transforms the Layers extension from a basic annotation tool into a professional-grade image editor suitable for serious content creation. The phased approach ensures that critical usability issues are addressed first, followed by feature expansion and polish.

**Estimated Development Time**: 16-20 weeks for full implementation
**Priority Focus**: Weeks 1-8 provide the most significant user experience improvements
**Success Metrics**: 
- User engagement increases by 300%
- Feature completeness reaches 85% for professional annotation needs
- Mobile usability becomes viable for basic editing tasks

The implementation should maintain backward compatibility with existing layer data while providing a migration path for enhanced features.
