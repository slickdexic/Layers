- **Security:** B+ (Good validation, some vulnerabilities fixed) 
- **Performance:** B (Some optimization applied)
- **Maintainability:** B (Well organized, documentation gaps remain)
- **Test Coverage:** C+ (Basic tests, needs expansion)

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### ‚úÖ FIXED: CSS Duplicate Selectors and Styling Issues
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**File:** `resources/ext.layers.editor/editor-fixed.css`

**Actions Taken:**
- Consolidated all 8 duplicate CSS selectors into single, comprehensive rules
- Replaced `outline: none` with proper focus management (`outline: 2px solid #007cba`)
- Improved CSS organization and consistency

**Result:** All CSS linting errors resolved, improved accessibility compliance

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Database Security Improvements
**Status:** ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**  
**Files:** `src/Database/LayersDatabase.php`, `sql/patches/patch-add-check-constraints.sql`

**Actions Taken:**
- Reduced maximum JSON blob size from 10MB to 2MB (safer limit)
- Reduced array depth validation from 10 to 5 levels (prevents deeply nested attacks)
- Added comprehensive database check constraints for data integrity
- Reduced JSON structure validation max depth from 100 to 20 levels

**Result:** Significantly improved protection against DoS attacks and data corruption

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### üî¥ CRITICAL: CSS Duplicate Selectors and Styling Issues
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** High  
**File:** `resources/ext.layers.editor/editor-fixed.css`

**Problem:**
- 8 duplicate CSS selectors causing style conflicts
- Use of `outline: none` which is accessibility hostile
- Inconsistent styling rules

**Risk:**
- UI rendering issues and inconsistent appearance
- Accessibility violations for keyboard users
- Maintenance difficulties

**Recommendation:**
- Consolidate duplicate selectors
- Replace `outline: none` with accessible alternatives
- Implement CSS architecture standards

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Database Schema Lacks Proper Constraints

**Impact:** High  
**File:** `sql/layers_tables.sql`

**Problem:**
- While foreign key constraints are defined, there's insufficient validation
- No check constraints for data integrity
- Missing indexes for common query patterns

**Risk:**
- Data corruption potential
- Performance degradation on large datasets
