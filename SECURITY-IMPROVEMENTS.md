# Security and Performance Improvements

This document outlines the critical improvements made to the MediaWiki Layers extension to address security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality problems.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Fixed**: Enhanced layer data validation with strict type checking and bounds validation
- **Fixed**: Improved color value validation to prevent CSS injection attacks
- **Fixed**: Added regex validation for layer IDs to prevent code injection
- **Fixed**: Stricter validation of text content to prevent XSS attacks
- **Fixed**: Enhanced filename validation to prevent path traversal attacks

#### XSS Prevention
- **Fixed**: Added comprehensive text content sanitization
- **Fixed**: Implemented strict whitelisting for color values
- **Fixed**: Added validation for font family names to prevent injection

#### Debug File Exposure
- **Fixed**: Removed all debug and test files from production code
- **Removed**: debug-*.php, test-*.php, quick-test.php, diagnose-layers.php

### 2. Performance Issues

#### Database Optimization
- **Fixed**: Added proper caching layer with size management
- **Fixed**: Implemented connection pooling and transaction management
- **Fixed**: Added database indexes for better query performance
- **Fixed**: Added size tracking fields to prevent large data operations

#### JavaScript Performance
- **Fixed**: Implemented requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- **Fixed**: Added layer visibility checking to skip invisible layers
- **Fixed**: Optimized mouse point calculations with caching
- **Fixed**: Added debouncing for state saving operations
- **Fixed**: Improved memory management in undo/redo system

#### Memory Management
- **Fixed**: Limited history cache size to prevent memory leaks
- **Fixed**: Implemented efficient deep cloning for layer data
- **Fixed**: Added proper cleanup in event handlers

### 3. Code Quality Issues

#### Error Handling
- **Fixed**: Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- **Fixed**: Comprehensive logging with fallback mechanisms
- **Fixed**: Graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable

#### Data Validation
- **Fixed**: Added comprehensive input validation for all user data
- **Fixed**: Implemented bounds checking for numeric values
- **Fixed**: Added data type validation for all layer properties

#### Rate Limiting
- **Fixed**: Enhanced rate limiting with user privilege consideration
- **Fixed**: Added different limits for different user groups
- **Fixed**: Improved complexity validation for layer operations

## Database Schema Improvements

### New Fields Added
- `ls_size`: Track data size for performance monitoring
- `ls_layer_count`: Track layer count for complexity validation
- `ls_usage_count`: Track usage patterns for optimization

### Index Improvements
- Added unique constraint on (img_name, img_sha1, revision)
- Added performance index on (ls_size, ls_layer_count)
- Added timestamp indexes for better query performance

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated with strict rules
2. **Output Sanitization**: All outputs are properly escaped and sanitized
3. **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Access Control**: Proper permission checking throughout the application
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Multi-level caching for database queries and computed values
2. **Lazy Loading**: Only load and render visible layers
3. **Debouncing**: Prevent excessive operations during user interactions
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and size limits to prevent memory issues
5. **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
2. **Type Safety**: Better type checking and validation
3. **Documentation**: Improved code documentation and comments
4. **Consistency**: Consistent coding patterns throughout the codebase
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security reviews
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor database query performance and memory usage
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
4. **Error Logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging and monitoring
5. **Code Reviews**: Mandatory code reviews for all changes
6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Breaking Changes

- Removed debug files that may have been used for development
- Enhanced validation may reject previously accepted invalid data
- Some performance optimizations may change timing behavior

## Migration Notes

When upgrading, ensure:
1. Database schema updates are applied (`php maintenance/update.php`)
2. No debug files are deployed to production
3. Rate limiting configuration is reviewed and adjusted if needed
4. User permissions are properly configured
